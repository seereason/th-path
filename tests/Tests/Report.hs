There are two types of jade, nephrite and jadeite. Nephrite has been used in China since prehistoric times for weapons and ritual objects. It wasn\8217t until the 18th century that large quantities of jadeite were imported from Burma, the country recognized as having some of the best jadeite in the world. The surface of jadeite tends to be vitreous or glassy while nephrite\8217s surface tends to appear more waxy. Pale colors such as lavender, light green, yellow are desirable, and the combination of colors such as lavender, white and green even more so.  Design, carving technique, and skillful exploitation of the jade\8217s colors are important characteristics of value. The same value characteristics  pertain to agate carving. Contemporary jade and agate carvings are typically found at decorative art galleries and regional auction houses that cater to enthusiasts of Asian collectibles. \n\nThe three ink paintings in the collection were acquired in mainland China in 2002. Only one of the artists, Xiao Shunzhi, has an international market. Market data for the other two artists, Liu Zuozhong and Li Jialin was not available, and the valuation of their works is based on comparable works by Chinese artists available in galleries in the United States and China. \n\n\n\n \n\t"}),(ReportElemID {unReportElemID = 1},ReportItem {elemItem = Item {itemName = "", fields = fromList [(ItemDataSheetNumber,rawMarkdown "1 A-B"),(ItemSubjectOrTitle,rawMarkdown "Pair of swan sculptures"),(ItemCondition,rawMarkdown "Very good: no evidence of damage or chips"),(ItemMarketAnalysis,rawMarkdown "Similar size, quality jadeite sculptures depicting mythical animals and birds are available for $19,200 and $25,000.

This is an antique RARE Lavender and Green Jadeite Sculpture representing peaches and flowers in a basket from China.\n\nThis beautiful sculpture is intricately carved, and the entire sculpture is a mixture of the lovely lavender and green colors. Due to its color, and its composition as Jadeite and not Nephrite, this sculpture is extremely rare. The lavender jadeite is a very rare color of jade, as it is usually found in colors between white and green. The Chinese artisans have used the naturally occurring placement of the lavender and green colors as the basis for their placement of the flowers and leaves. The basket is very lifelike and detailed.\n\nThe basket of flowers and fruits rests on a rosewood stand.\n\nThis beautiful jadeite sculpture measures 6\" high, 5\" long, and 2\" deep. With the stand, the height is 7 \189\8221. This sculpture was created in the early 20th Century.\nThis item is listed at $3,500.00*but smaller in scale (6\" high, 5\" long) jadeite sculpture  is available at an online gallery for $3,500.\"\n\nThe subject property is approximately 2x the size of the jade basket available at P.M.
